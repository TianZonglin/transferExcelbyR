  class="font9">ORIGINAL:</font><font class="font6"> Recently-formed major U.S.
  food and beverage company The Kraft Heinz Co has agreed to buy 100% in
  Russian children's food producer Ivanovo Plant of Baby Food, according to a
  resolution of the Federal Antimonopoly Service. The buyer will act in the
  transaction via Dutch-registered subsidiary H. J. Heinz Holding BV. According
  to information of the state corporate register, as cited by Vedomosti daily,
  Ivanovo Plant of Baby Food belongs to Cyprus-registered firm Russian Babyfood
  Investment Company Limited, reportedly affiliated to Russian-Serbian citizen
  Goran Vukovich. The deal price was not disclosed. The market valuation of the
  target's business is in the range RUB 0.8-1.2bn (USD 12.4-18.6mn). However,
  considering the high debt burden of the company as at end 2014 - RUB 2.73bn
  (USD 48.1mn), the actual price of the stake could depend on the buyer,
  Raiffeisenbank's analyst Natalya Kolupaeva said, as cited by Vedomosti.
  Ivanovo Plant of Baby Food produces fruit and vegetable purees, juices and
  cereals under the brand name Umnitsa. The company has already released
  production under a contract with Heinz. In 2014, the revenue of Ivanovo Plant
  of Baby Food was RUB 1.17bn (USD 31mn). The company had a net profit from
  basic operations of RUB 411.5mn (USD 10.9mn) but due to the high volume of
  ‘other expenses' worth around RUB 1bn (USD 26.5mn), it registered a
  bottom-line loss. The Kraft Heinz Co was formed in start-July 2015 as a
  result of the merger of U.S. processed foods manufacturers H.J. Heinz Co and
  Kraft Foods Group Inc. The new entity became the fifth largest food and
  beverage company in the world. Its product portfolio comprises ketchup,
  sauces, meals, soups, potato products, snacks and infant nutrition. The
  company's combined revenue is USD 28bn. Kraft Heinz Co operates two plants in
  Russia - one in Stavropol region (production of cereals) and another one in
  Leningrad region (production of ketchups, sauces, spreads and mayonnaises). </font><font

  has acquired additional 30% stake in the company from his U.S. media partner
  Hearst Corp, Vedomosti daily reported, citing the buyer. Prior to that, the
  two shareholders held equal stakes in the company. Financial terms of the
  transaction were not disclosed. The acquired stake is basically valued at
  over EUR 100mn (USD 109.7mn). However, according to market players,
  considering the crisis on the media market and the extreme conditions of the
  sale, the consideration, in case of cash payment, hardly exceeded a few tens
  of millions of euros. The ownership change is in compliance with the Russian
  legislation on limiting the stakes of foreign investors in Russian media
  companies up to 20% shareholding. In end-July and start-August 2015, two
  companies were registered for control of the target’s assets - Hearst Shkulev
  Publishing and Hearst Shkulev Digital Media. The first is responsible for
  publishing magazines and development of the internet editions. The second one
  is in charge of the regional resources of the holding (NGS group sites and

  publisher of Elle, Marie Claire, Maxim, Psychologies and other popular

  both companies applied for the withdrawal of authorization universal service
  licences. Following the current deal, Fogaz will become the sole gas services
  supplier on the regulated market in the country. Through the deal, Fogaz will
  increase its customer base to over three million customers. Tigaz supplies
  gas in a more than 33,000 km long distribution network and connection pipes
  to almost one-third of the Hungarian residential and corporate customers, in

  Stanmore said, quoted by media sources, that it would be responsible for AUD
  32mn (USD 23.33mn) in rehabilitation costs related to the mine. In addition,
  it secured a USD 42mn loan from Taurus Mining Finance Fund to help finance a
  return to production. The company plans to restart mining at Isaac Plains in
  the first half of 2016, while cutting production to only 1.1 million tonnes
  per year. Stanmore explores coal in Australia. The company's portfolio of
  coal assets includes interests of over 2,000 km2 within Queensland's Bowen
  and Surat Basin coal provinces. The firm had total assets of AUD 59mn (USD
  43.02mn), as of 31 December 2015. _________________________________________________________________________________________________

  citada por fontes da mídia, que seria responsável pelos custos de
  reabilitação de AUD 32mn (USD 23.33mn ), relacionados com a mina. A empresa
  também garantiu um empréstimo de USD 42mn do Taurus Mining Finance Fund para
  financiar os custos de produção. A empresa pretende reiniciar as atividades
  de mineração nas planícies de Isaac, no primeiro semestre de 2016 e reduzir a
  produção para apenas 1.1 milhões de toneladas por ano. A Stanmore é uma

  generates strong cash flow. The deal is subject to customary closing conditions

  <td class=xl74>The Board of Directors of Russian oil com<span
  style='display:none'>pany Bashneft decided that the latter’s subsidiary
  United Petrochemical Company (UPC) will buy the remaining 49% stake in
  Russia-registered chemical joint venture RusPETF from Mexican petrochemical
  group Alpek SAB de CV, according to an announcement of Bashneft. The
  acquisition will be carried out via the purchase of 49% in Dutch-based RusPET
  Holding BV, the parent company of RusPETF, from Mexican company Grupo
  Petrotemex, a daughter of Alpek SAB de CV. The consideration payable will not
  exceed EUR 4mn (USD 4.43mn). The decision was taken in accordance with a
  directive from the Government of the Russian Federation and is connected with
  the recent ownership changes in Bashneft when the company was transferred to
  state control. The JV contract was signed in late September 2013 and
  envisaged the creation of a company for construction of an integrated plant
  to produce purified terephthalic acid (PTA) and polyethylene terephthalate
  (PET) in Ufa, Bashkortostan. The projected maximum installed capacity of the
  plant was 600,000 tonnes of PTA and 600,000 tonnes of PET. Alpek and UPC
  planned to invest USD 10mn each in the project that was meant to serve the
  Russian market. In December 2014, Grupo Petrotemex decided to retrieve from
  the joint venture. Bashneft specializes in oil production and refining in
  Russia's Republic of Bashkortostan, Western Siberia and Orenburg region. In
  2014, Bashneft ranked sixth in terms of oil production and fourth in terms of
  crude oil refining among Russian peers. As of 31 December 2014, Bashneft’s
  retail network comprised 802 own and partner filling stations in 27 regions
  of Russia.</span></td>

  board chairman Gagik Zakaryan and Georgy Piskov sold 10% each in the bank.
  Thus, Artem Avetisyan purchased the entire equity of Uniastrum Bank. The deal
  value for the whole asset was not specified. In a separate announcement, Bank
  of Cyprus Group confirmed the completion of the deal. </font><font
  class="font9">ORIGINAL:</font><font class="font6"> Nicosia-based Bank of
  Cyprus Group said it agreed to sell 80% in its Russian units Uniastrum Bank
  and Uniastrum Leasing to Russian businessman Artem Avetisyan and his
  affiliates for EUR 7mn (USD 7.64mn). The deal involved also the sale of
  certain other Russian loan exposures. The transaction is subject to customary
  regulatory waivers and is expected to complete by end-Q3 2015. The disposal
  is in compliance with the Group's strategy to offload non-core assets and
  focus on main operations and markets. In addition, the seller reportedly
  evades any potential future liquidity risks with regard to its Russian
  activities. Furthernore, the sale enables the de-risking of about EUR 700mn
  (USD 763.7mn) on the balance sheet of the Group and improves its Common Equity
  Tier 1 capital ratio with around 30 basis points. The overall net exposure of
  the bank in Russia will be reduced to EUR 114mn (USD 124.4mn) of loans and
  real estate assets expected to be offloaded over time. The existence of the
  two representative offices of Bank of Cyprus in Moscow and St Petersburg will
  not be affected by the deal. Bank of Cyprus purchased 80% in Uniastrum Bank
  in June 2008 for USD 576mn. Uniastrum Bank was founded in 1994 and provides
  universal financial services. The bank operates 170 offices in 45 Russian
  regions. As at 1 June 2015, the bank reported RUB 56.6bn (USD 1.08bn) in
  total assets, ranking 93rd in Russia, as well as RUB 6.1bn (USD 116.3mn) in
  own capital, according to data of Banki.ru. Uniastrum Leasing offers commercial
  real estate leasing services as well as leasing of equipment and transport
  vehicles. Artem Avetisyan is the majority shareholder in Russia's Bank
  Regional Credit. </font><font class="font9">Note:</font><font class="font6">
