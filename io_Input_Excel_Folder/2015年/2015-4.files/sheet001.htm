  style='display:none'>onal has bought back 7.4% of its shares for USD 300mn
  from company Sumeru Gold BV of Kazakh businessman Timur Kulibaev under an
  earlier put option agreement between the companies, Polymetal announced.
  Simultaneously, Russian financial corporation Otkritie Holding purchased the
  stake from Polymetal for USD 232mn. The settlement of the put option was
  included in an earlier transaction when Polymetal agreed to acquire the Kyzyl
  gold project in Kazakhstan from Sumeru Gold in May 2014. Then Polymetal had
  to issue 31,347,078 new ordinary shares worth USD 300mn along with the
  consideration payable for the deposit. Sumeru received a put option to
  require Polymetal to acquire or procure acquirers for the issued shares
  during the one-month period commencing 4 September 2015 at a price equal to
  USD 9.57 per share. The consideration payable by Otkritie to Polymetal
  represents the average closing price of Polymetal shares for the period being
  one month ended five business days before the date of signing the agreement,
  i.e. USD 7.41 per share. Polymetal settled the difference of USD 68mn to USD
  300mn from its free cash flow. Thus the company ensured its stable balance
  sheet position and the regular payment of dividends. Under the current
  contract, Otkritie Holding pledged not to dispose of any interest in 90% of
  the shares purchased for a lock-up period of six months. Jersey-registered
  Polymetal International is a leading Russian silver, gold and copper
  producer. The company also has operations in Kazakhstan. Company's shares are
  listed on the London and Moscow stock exchanges. Otkritie is a full-service
  financial corporation offering retail, corporate and institutional clients a
  wide range of banking, investment, insurance and pension plan solutions. It
  has over 22,000 employees and provides services to 186,000 corporate and some

  country, and over 1,000 employees. Aman operates its retail network under
  private label brands such as Bravo, Bravissimo, Alloro and VIP. Recently, in

  <td class=xl74>Belarusian entrepreneur Arthur Granz and <span
  style='display:none'>his Ukrainian partner Rysbek Toktomushev, as well as
  several undisclosed private investors, have acquired the oil-processing
  assets of local agribusiness holding Creative Group from the founder
  Stanislav Berezkin, Forbes magazine reported citing the target's press
  service. As specified, the new investors took 80% of the oils extraction
  business as well as the production of fats, margarine and spreads. According
  to sources of Forbes, Berezkin sold 17 out of all 65 enterprises of Creative
  Group. Toktomushev later specified, as cited by the magazine, that the plant
  for production of soybean oil and meal, as well as the other agricultural
  business of Creative Group was not part of the acquisition. The brand
  Creative will also be transferred to the new shareholders. The purchased
  assets include capacities for processing of 1 million tonnes of sunflower and
  production of 144,000 tonnes of fats and margarine per year, as well as
  several elevators. Arthur Granz will be the holder of the larger share
  package in Creative Group whose exact volume was not disclosed. Granz is a
  financial investor while Toktomushev claims to be a managing shareholder. The
  remaining new investors, two citizens of Ukraine and one foreign citizen,
  will hold minority stakes and will not take active part in the management of
  the business. The deal value was kept confidential. A source of Forbes
  briefed with the deal details claims that the enterprise value of the sold
  assets was around USD 550mn, of which USD 30mn was paid in cash to the seller
  and the remaining USD 520mn represented company debt. Further USD 110mn of
  the debt will have to be covered by Berezkin. The new investors plan to
  restart the production at Creative's plants which employ around 1,500 people,
  as well as to cut off spending, close unpromising lines of business,
  restructure debt and actively develop the core operations. Until end-2013,
  Creative Group was profitable and entered the TOP 3 leaders in Ukraine in
  terms of sunflower-seed processing, exports of sunflower fats and soyabean
  processing. Prior to its sale, around 80% of the group's liabilities were
  towards state banks.</span></td>

  Saenz SA announced it has submitted an offer for the acquisition of its local
  counterpart La Farmaco Argentina I y CSA from Anglo-Dutch multinational
  consumer goods company Unilever NV. Saenz said that on 9 September 2016,
  Argentina Investments BV and Mixhold BV, both subsidiaries of Unilever,
  approved the offer and agreed to receive an upfront payment of ARS 24.23mn
  (USD 2.6mn), a sum which corresponds to 25% of La Farmaco's capital. Other players
  interested in the acquisition of La Farmaco were Peruvian food manufacturer
  Alicorp SAA and Argentinean personal care products manufacturer Prifamon SA.
  The transaction is subject to regulatory and other approvals. La Farmaco
  Argentina manufactures and sells personal care and beauty products under the
  brand names Veritas, Vo5, Antiall, Farmaco, TRESemme, and St.Ives. The
  company's manufacturing plant is located in the Buenos Aires province and
  produces liquids, powders and semisolids. Unilever was obliged to divest the
  above-mentioned assets due to its monopolistic position which it gained
  following the acquisition of its U.S. peer Alberto Culver Co five years ago.
  The company will retain the TRESemme and St.Ives brands. Santiago Saenz
  engages in the manufacturing of detergents, insecticide aerosol sprays,
  disinfectants and air fresheners. Unilever is a fast-moving consumer goods
  company offering food, beverage, personal care, home care and other products.

  <td class=xl70>Russian agricultural holding RusAgro Grou<span
  style='display:none'>p has approved the acquisition of a 75% stake in local
  soy processing company Primorskaya Soya, the buyer said in a press release.
  The financial terms of the acquisition were not announced. Primorskaya Soya
  is located in Primorsky region. The plant has the capacity to process 450
  tonnes of soy per day. It also produces bottled soybean oil and mayonnaise.
  According to information of the state corporate register, Primorskaya Soya
  was registered in end-May 2015. Cyprus-based firm Grandim Ltd holds 75% in the
  company and private investor Tatyana Gerasimenko - 25%. The daily further
  elaborates, citing the holding’s general director Maxim Basov, that
  Primorskaya Soya is one of the creditors of ailing Ussuriysk Plant of Fats
  and Oils, an exclusive supplier of soybean flour to RusAgro Group. Through
  the above deal, RusAgro Group could possibly gain rights to claim the debt of
  the plant in Ussuriysk. Thus RusAgro could eventually comply with its
  strategy and create capacities for soybean processing in Primorsky region on
  the basis of Ussuriysk Plant of Fats and Oils after gaining control in the
  company. RusAgro Group is a leading Russian producer of sugar. It is also
  active in meats, oil and fats manufacturing, as well as other branches of
  agricultural business.</span></td>

  India's global diversified enterprise Kewalram Chanrai Group for SGD 610.4mn
  (USD 435.4mn). The buyer has acquired 221,962,556 Olam ordinary shares at SGD
  2.75 (USD 1.96) apiece. In a separate transaction, Mitsubishi has also
  subscribed for around 332.7 million new ordinary shares for SGD 915.0mn (USD
  652.7mn) in a private placement on the Singapore Exchange. The shares represents
  a 12.0% stake in Olam's enlarged share capital. The offered price represents
  a premium of 54.5% over the weighted average price of SGD 1.78 for trades
  done on 26 August 2015, the full market day prior to the announcement. The
  combined acquired stake (20%) worth a total of SGD 1.52bn (USD 1.06bn).

  shareholder, having the right to nominate up to two members to the Olam board

  materials such as coffee, cocoa and edible nuts. Through the deal, Olam will
  establish a long term strategic partnership with a strong and reputed
  industry player such as Mitsubishi Corp and it will also set a platform for
  collaboration across multiple geographies and products. Olam and Mitsubishi
  are already in discussions to establish a joint venture company (JV) in Japan
  to distribute specific products of Olam that can leverage on Mitsubishi's
  strong distribution and retail presence. Established in 1989, Olam is a
  leading agri-business that supplies food and industrial raw materials in 65
  countries worldwide. It deals in some 44 products, including cashew, sesame,
  dehydrated onion and garlic, almond, hazelnut, cocoa, coffee, rice, grains
  dairy, cotton and timber, supplying some 13,800 client companies globally. It
  employs around 23,000 people and it posted revenues of SGD 18.31bn (USD
  13.06bn) for FY ended 31 June 2015. Mitsubishi Corp, founded in 1954, is a

  global environmental &amp; infrastructure; industrial finance, logistics and

  Orion Mine Finance as main co-investor, for USD 300mn. The USD 300mn deal
