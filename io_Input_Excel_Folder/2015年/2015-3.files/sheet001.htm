  class="font6"> South African internet and media group Naspers Ltd said it has
  agreed to acquire from existing shareholders an additional 50.5% stake in
  Russia's largest online classifieds service Avito (Avito.ru) for USD 1.2bn.
  Swedish funds Investment AB Kinnevik, Northzone Ventures, as well as
  U.S.-based fund Accel Partners, have exited the target's list of
  shareholders, Vedomosti daily reported, citing Vladimir Pravdivy, Avito's
  executive director. Baring Vostok Capital Partners and the company founders,
  Jonas Nordlander and Filip Engelbert, sold their holdings only partially.
  Kinnevik specified in a separate statement that it sold its entire stake of
  31% for USD 846mn. The transaction is subject to antitrust approvals and
  clearance by the South African Reserve Bank. After the sale is completed, the
  distribution of stakes will be as follows: Naspers Ltd - 67.9%, Swedish fund
  Vostok Nafta Investment - 13.3%, Baring Vostok Capital Partners - 4.2%,
  company founders and management - 10% and 4.6% respectively, Pravdivy noted,
  as cited by Vedomosti. Four out of all seven seats at Avito's board of
  directors will be taken by Naspers representatives, the daily said, citing
  sources from Avito. With the current transaction, Naspers Ltd is said to
  further enhance its position as a global leader in online classifieds. Martin
  Scheepbouwer, CEO of Naspers Classifieds, was quoted as saying that the deal
  will boost Naspers' exposure to the attractive and extensive online market in
  Russia. Avito was set up in 2007. In May 2013, the company finalised its
  merger with Russia-focused Naspers' internet classified sites OLX and Slando
  under the Avito brand. Avito is a platform that enables buyers and sellers,
  both private individuals and companies, to make mutually beneficial deals.
  The company's key sectors of focus are general goods, automotive, real
  estate, jobs and services. Avito registers some 35 million unique monthly
  visits and 8.6 billion page views. The company claims to be in the Top 10
  Russian internet resources. Over 50% of Avito's traffic comes from mobile
  devices. In 2014, Avito generated sales of USD 76.5mn with an EBITDA margin
  of 50.6%. Founded in 1915, Naspers is a global platform operator with
  principal operations in internet services, especially e-commerce (i.e.
  classifieds, online retail, marketplaces, online comparison shopping,
  payments and online services), pay television (direct-to-home satellite
  services, digital terrestrial television services and online services), and
  print media. Naspers has been primary listed on the Johannesburg Stock
  Exchange (JSE) in South Africa since 1994. In 2014, Naspers Ltd posted
  consolidated sales of ZAR 62.7bn (USD 5.78bn).</font></span></td>

  unexplored and underdeveloped. Licences 4143L, 4258L and 5030L cover an area
  of 15,800 ha and are located close to reportedly the world's single largest
  ruby deposit held by Gemfields. In the year ended 30 June 2015, Gemfields

  style='display:none'><font class="font6">ed, both INEOS and DEA Deutsche
  Erdoel AG (through which LetterOne Group acted as seller) announced in
  separate press statements. </font><font class="font9">ORIGINAL:</font><font
  class="font6"> Swiss chemicals major INEOS Group Ltd said it agreed to
  acquire several gas fields in the North Sea from LetterOne Group, the energy
  assets vehicle set up by Russian investment holding company Alfa Group
  Consortium. The deal value was not disclosed. According to banking sources,
  as cited by Reuters, the assets were valued at about USD 750mn, LetterOne
  initially expected to receive some USD 1-1.2bn for the gas fields. The
  transaction is pending approval from the European Commission and is expected
  to close later in 2015. In March 2014, LetterOne agreed to acquire the gas
  licences in question (around 40) as a part of a EUR 4.5bn (USD 6.3bn)
  acquisition of RWE Dea, the Hamburg-based oil and gas unit of German indebted
  utility group RWE AG. The deal was closed in March 2015 but the British
  authorities refused to approve it and gave LetterOne six months to dispose of
  the UK assets, threatening to revoke the licences. The UK government was
  worried that the gas supplies from the respective fields in the North Sea
  could be blocked in case of future sanctions against Russia. As reported, the
  acquired assets will contribute to INEOS' European energy and feedstock
  strategy as the company is one of the major operators of chemical plants and
  a large consumer of hydrocarbons. The assets will be operated by the new
  INEOS Upstream business division to be seated in London. The U.K. North Sea
  gas fields reportedly provide up to 8% of the gas in the U.K. The largest of
  them, Breagh and Clipper South, are located close to existing INEOS' sites in
  the North East and Scotland. INEOS is a global manufacturer of
  petrochemicals, speciality chemicals and oil products. Its network spans 65
  sites in 16 countries throughout the world. The group's annual turnover is
  USD 54bn. INEOS earlier voiced an intention to be the leading UK player in
  onshore gas development. The company also holds several shale gas licences in
  England and Scotland and is set to invest USD 1bn in a project to supply U.S.
  shale gas to the UK and Norway. The owners of Alfa Group Consortium, Mikhail
  Fridman and German Khan, founded LetterOne Group in 2013 with the purpose to
  invest part of the capital they obtained from the sale of their ownership in
  TNK-BP, the Russian arm of British oil major BP.</font></span></td>

  class="font9">ORIGINAL:</font><font class="font6"> Russian commercial TV
  broadcaster UTH Russia, via subsidiary UTV-Management, has agreed to acquire
  a 75% stake in local peer CTC Media for USD 200mn in cash, the target company
  said in a press statement. In start-July 205, UTH submitted the respective non-binding
  offer for the shares of CTC Media. CTC Media will act in the transaction via
  subsidiary CTC Investments. The transaction is subject to regulatory and
  stockholders approvals. The closing is due in late December 2015. Until the
  completion of the transaction, CTC Media will receive all of the available
  free cash from the operating business expected to be USD 55mn. The final sale
  price of the assets will be calculated taking into account the possible
  differences between the actual cash flow from operating and investing
  activities in H2 2015 and current expectations of the company for that
  period, as well as considering the possible payment of the agreed commitments
  of the company for reimbursement and compensation. In addition, USD 15mn will
  remain in the company as working capital for the continuation of current
  activities after the deal closing. Currently, the largest shareholders of CTC
  Media are Swedish holding Modern Times Group (MTG) (37.9%) and Telcrest
  Investments Ltd (25%) controlled by Russian businessman Yury Kovalchuk who
  fell under the U.S. sanctions. Some 36% of the shares are in free float on
  the NASDAQ stock exchange, believed to be in the hands of primarily foreign
  investors. The sale is in compliance with the Russian legislation which
  stipulates that foreign legal entities should possess no more than 20% in
  media companies, starting from 2016. On a related note, CTC Media committed
  to approve an additional share issue in favour of UTH after the closing of
  the transaction, resulting in UTH concentrating 80% in CTC Investments. UTH
  is to pay for the additional stake with promissory notes. CTC Media operates
  four television channels in Russia (CTC, Domashniy, Peretz and CTC Love) as
  well as Channel 31 in Kazakhstan with combined audience of the five channels
  exceeding 150 million viewers. The international version of CTC Channel is
  available in North America, Europe, Central Asia, Armenia, Georgia,
  Azerbaijan, the Middle East and Kyrgyzstan. The international version of
  Peretz Channel is available in Belarus and Kyrgyzstan. CTC Media also owns
  several digital entertainment media assets including videomore.ru,
  domashniy.ru, ctc.ru and peretz.ru. In 2014, CTC Media reported USD 711.4mn
  in revenue. UTH Russia was set up following the merger of Media One Holdings
  Ltd's and Art Finance &amp; Media Ltd's television assets in August 2009. It
  is a fast-growing commercial TV broadcaster whose main assets are U Channel,
  Disney Channel and cable channel MUZ-TV. The company also runs licensed music
