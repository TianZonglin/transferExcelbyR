  Upon the completion of the transaction, Arapoti mill will be 80% owned by

  Arauco. Arapoti's plantation company in which Stora Enso has a 20%
  participation, is not part of the transaction. Mrs. Kati ter Horst, EVP Paper
  division at Stora Enso, said that Papeles Bio Bio will benefit of the good
  technical condition of the paper mill, as well as of its portfolio of loyal
  customers. Arapoti mill is the only South American producer of coated
  magazine paper (LWC). Its production is mainly sold in Brazil, but also to
  some Latin American countries. The factory has an annual production capacity
  of 185,000 tonnes of LWC. Stora Enso Oyj was formed in 1998, as a merger
  between Swedish mining and forestry products company Stora and Finnish

  undisclosed third-party investors, the target company announced. According to
  the press release, the buyers have not been related to UNIStream before.
  Allegedly, the buyers are several private investors which acted on behalf of
  the bank's main shareholders - Gagik Zakaryan and Georgy Piskov, Kommersant
  daily reported. The financial terms of the sale were not specified. Several
  sources of Kommersant deem that the price is rather similar to the one set by
  the fund itself in its financial report for the period 1 April - 30 September
  2015. According to the report, as at 30 September 2015 the stake of 26% in
  UNIStream was valued at GBP 3.4mn (USD 5.29mn). Aurora Russia started to exit
  Russian assets in 2013. The current holding in UNIStream was the last one
  left in its portfolio. The leaving of Aurora Russia will not impact the
  bank's development strategy for the period until 2018. UNIStream plans to
  expand its presence on the market of money transfers and remittances, as well
  as to develop products and services for payment agents and SMEs. UNIStream
  money transfer service started its operations in 2001 as a division of
  Russian lender Uniastrum Bank. In 2006, UNIStream was split from Uniastrum
  Bank and received a separate banking licence of its own. Today, UNIStream has
  an almost 60% market share in some CIS countries, representative offices in

  Swiss oil trader Gunvor has agreed to sell a 50% stake in Novorossiysk Fuel
  Oil Terminal to a structure of Russia's monopoly pipeline transportation
  operator Transneft, according to a resolution of the Federal Antimonopoly
  Service. The buyer will act in the acquisition via subsidiary Chernomorskie
  Magistralnye Nefteprovody. The press secretary of Transneft, Igor Demin, was
  quoted by Vedomosti daily as saying that his company is buying Gunvor's stake
  but the purchase has not completed yet. Financial terms of the agreement were
  not specified. At present, Novorossiysk Fuel Oil Terminal is held on a parity
  basis by Gunvor and Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port (NCSP). Transneft is
  also a shareholder in NCSP. According to earlier media reports, Gunvor is in the
  process of re-balancing its global asset portfolio, which implies both buying
  and selling assets. Since a major part of the company's assets are in Russia,
  Gunvor was considering the possibilities for selling some of these assets. In
  March 2014, Russian tycoon Gennady Timchenko exited the capital of Gunvor by
  selling his 44% in the company to his partner Torbjorn Tornqvist. The sale
  took place just a day prior to U.S. government imposing sanctions against
  Timchenko and other Russian tycoons for being affiliated with the Russian
  president Vladimir Putin. Novorossiysk Fuel Oil Terminal can handle tankers
  with deadweight of over 47,000 tons. The terminal has two 250-meter parallel
  jetties and capacity to store up to 119,000 cubic meters of fuel, according
  to data from Gunvor's website. In 2014, Novorossiysk Fuel Oil Terminal posted
  net sales of USD 67.4mn and booked a net loss of USD 28.15mn. Transneft is
  100% in federal ownership. The company transports 90% of the oil extracted in
  Russia. Transneft operates 70,000 km of trunk pipelines, more than 500
  pumping stations as well as over 22mn m3 of storage tanks.</font></span></td>

  foreign exchange control that restricts remittances of currency outside the

  <td class=xl70>U.S. oil and gas major ConocoPhillips Co <span
  style='display:none'>has sold its 50% stake in Russian oil firm Polar Lights,
  a joint venture with Russian peer Rosneft, The Financial Times reported. The
  buyer is shell company Trisonnery Asset Ltd. According to a source of the
  daily, familiar with the matter, the final beneficiary is the Belarusian
  Khotin family. On 17 December 2015, Rosneft also announced the sale of its
  50% in the JV to an undisclosed investor. According to a source of Financial
  Times briefed with the details, the deal valued the company at USD 150-200mn.
  The Russian media earlier speculated that Russian oil and gas firm
  Tatneftegaz-Sever and structures of Belarusian businessmen Yury Khotin and
  his son Aleksey Khotin are the potential buyers of the asset. The current
  transaction marks the full retreat of ConocoPhillips from the Russian market
  after more than 25 years of presence. ConocoPhillips announced the sale of
  its last asset in Russia in 2014. As reported, the exit was not provoked by
  the U.S. and EU sanctions against Russia but by the fact that the asset is
  the only one left and too small to keep. Polar Lights was established in 1992
  and holds the licences to develop five oil fields in Russia's Nenets
  autonomous district. At the beginning of the development, the recoverable
  reserves of the company were estimated at 16mn tonnes of oil. However, output
  from the fields developed by Polar Lights has been decreasing in recent
  years, and was down to 410,000 tonnes in 2014 from around 700,000 tonnes
  produced in 2010. Yury Khotin and Alexey Khotin started to collect oil and
  gas assets in Russia back in 2012 when they acquired 100% in company Dulisma.
  In 2013, they purchased 30% in Exillon Energy. In June 2014, Dulisma bought a
  100% stake in local peer Irelyakhneft from Russian major diamond miner Alrosa.
  In November 2015, the Khotins acquired domestic oil and gas company Negusneft
  from diversified holding Sintez Group. The Khotins are also one of the
  largest property developers in Russia. <font class="font9">Note:</font><font

  The financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Alexander

  funds. Viacom started to look for investors in Russia with regard to the
  latest local legislative rulings which stipulate that a foreign investor
  should not possess more than 20% in a Russian media company. The legal
  amendments come into force in the beginning of 2016. The outbound arm of
  Viacom, Viacom International Media Networks, distributes 12 entertainment and

  the Government of Finland, according to a press release of the target. The
  sale price was EUR 251.3mn (USD 272.7mn). As a result of the transaction, the
  state will consolidate 100% in Gasum Oy. In November 2014, the Finnish
  government purchased the stakes of the other two shareholders in Gasum -
  local utility Fortum and German E.ON. Investors lost interest in the target
  asset because of the EU requirements of the Third Energy Package. In
  addition, Gazprom did not agree with the amended strategy for gaining access
  to the end consumer. As Kommersant daily reminds, Gazprom wanted to exit
  Gasum Oy in end-November 2014 but the Finnish state linked the negotiations
  with the discussions of the contract price for the imported gas. In the end,
  Gazprom agreed on a small additional discount of the gas price. Gasum Oy is
  an integrated gas company whose activities comprise natural gas importing,
  upgrade and distribution for industrial use and for homes. The company is the
  leading supplier of biogas in Finland and owns the majority of the LNG
  distribution business of Norwegian company Skangass. In 2014, Gasum Oy
  reported EUR 1.1bn (USD 1.46bn) in revenues.</span></td>

  since early 2015, after first writing down the value of the business by some
  USD 685mn in 2014 due to uncertainties in the renewable energy sector.
  Founded in 1992, Pacific Hydro is mainly engaged in wind and hydroelectric
  energy generation, and also solar and geothermal energy. As of end-2013, the
  company had 919.8 MW of generating assets in Australia, Chile and Brazil, in

  book EBITDA of USD 175mn in 2015, with 52% of earnings coming from Chile, 41%
  from Australia and 7% from Brazil, according to AFR. State Power Investment
  Corp (SPIC) is a Chinese state-owned enterprise with significant interests

  Investment Corporation and State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation in

  <td class=xl70>Norway-based oil and gas company Statoil <span
  style='display:none'>ASA announced it has reached an asset swap agreement
  with Spanish peer Respol SA, in order to increase its operatorship in Brazil,
  the U.K., the U.S. and Norway, achieve greater control on asset development
  and reduce costs. Under the agreement, Statoil will acquire a 31% interest in
  the U.K. licence for Alfa Sentral natural gas field in the North Sea (across
  both the U.K. Continental Shelf and Norwegian Continental Shelf), increasing
  its shareholding up to 55%. The buyer also acquires from Repsol a 13% stake
  in the Eagle Ford joint venture located in the southern part of Texas state
  (U.S.), and will become its operator with a 63% share. Finally, Statoil will
  assume operatorship from Repsol of the BM-C-33 licence in Campos Basin oil
  and gas exploration area offshore in Brazil (located 120 km off the coast of
  Rio de Janeiro state). After this last transaction, Statoil will keep its 35%
  stake in the field. Repsol will receive from Statoil in exchange for the
  assets a 15% interest in the Gudrun oil and gas field (located on the
  Norwegian Continental Shelf). Upon the completion of the transaction, Statoil
  remains the operator and largest equity holder with a 36% interest in the
  field. The transactions for Gudrun and Eagle Ford are valued at the same amount
  and are expected to close before the end of 2015. The transfer of the assets
  and the operatorship of BM-C-33 will be concluded, once they receive certain
  regulatory approvals. According to Mr. John Knight, Statoil's Executive
  Vice-President for Global Strategy &amp; Business Development, the agreement
  on Alfa Sentral will increase the company's holding in the U.K. licence for
  the field, as well as its potential future profitability. The Eagle Ford
  joint venture will help Statoil to expand its international activity, through
  efficient operations and cost saving. The operatorship of BM-C-33 in Brazil
  will allow Statoil to use its deep-water and gas expertise to develop the
  exploration of the field. Alfa Sentral is a field that is currently producing
  60 million boe/d. Statoil is the operator in the Norwegian Continental Shelf
  licence with a 62% holding and acquired a 24% interest in the UK Continental
  Shelf licence on 2 October 2015 for USD 15mn. Eagle Ford started operating in
  2010 as a 50/50 joint venture between Statoil and Talisman Energy USA Inc.
  Initially, the field produced around four thousand boe/d. Exploration Licence
  BM-C-33, comprises the Pao de Acucar, Gavea and Seat discoveries in Campos
  Basin oil and gas exploration area offshore in Brazil. In 2012 block
  resources were estimated at around 700 million barrels of light crude and
  three trillion cubic feet of gas. There will be an appraisal campaign that
  will reestimate the discovered potential. The Gudrun field holds 130 million
  of boe. Production started in April 2014 and in 2015 production is currently
  at 75 thousand boe/d. Statoil specialises in exploration and production of
  crude oil and gas, and transportation, refining, and marketing of gas,
  petroleum and petroleum-derived products and has proven reserves of
  approximately 5.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Listed on the Oslo Stock

  South Eastern European countries, including Albania, Bulgaria, Bosnia and
  Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Romania and others. The first TAP gas
  deliveries to Europe are planned for early 2020, with an initial capacity of
  10 bcm (10 billion cubic meters) per year. TAP will open the so-called
  Southern Gas Corridor, enhancing Europe's energy security by contributing to

  Russian commercial lender Expobank agreed to acquire 100% in the Russian
  subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) for an undisclosed amount, the
  buyer announced. The acquisition is expected to complete in early Q2 2016
  subject to approvals from the Central Bank. IFCMarkets analyst, Dmitry
  Lukashov, as cited by RBC news agency, values the asset at half of its own
  capital given the devaluation of Russian banks due to the mass revocation of
  operation licences. As of 1 November 2015, Royal Bank of Scotland (Russia)
  reported RUB 5.9bn (USD 92.3mn) of equity capital. Thus the transaction could
  have made around RUB 2.95bn (USD 44.3mn). Expobank's CEO Kirill Nifontov is
  quoted as saying in the press release that the purchase aligns with the
  bank's strategy on organic growth and business development through mergers
  and acquisitions. In February 2015, Royal Bank of Scotland announced its exit
  from 25 countries in Central and Eastern Europe, Middle Asia and Africa,
  including Russia. The bank plans to focus on regions where it has stable
  leading positions and observes maximum growth potential. RBS entered the
  Russian market in 2008 with the acquisition of Dutch bank ABN Amro. The bank
  specialises in servicing large legal entities and mainly foreign companies with
  interests in Russia. RBS Russia also arranges syndicated loans and trade
  financing to Russian companies-borrowers. As of 1 November 2015, the total
  assets of RBS Russia fell more than two times since the start of 2015 - down
  to RUB 28.5bn (USD 445.8mn). In 2014, the bank posted net profit of RUB 212mn

  businessman Igor Kim (66.6%). The bank has 19 branch-offices in 11 Russian
  cities, servicing more than 100,000 private clients and around 7,500 legal

  Blackstone has agreed to <span style='display:none'>acquire a majority stake
  in the Cone Suape warehouse project (municipality of Cabo de Santo Agostinho,
  Pernambuco state), operated by port and industrial complex manager Cone SA,
  Brazilian media sources reported. Financial terms were not disclosed. According
  to Brazilian media Valor Economico, Cone SA will hold a minority stake in the
  project. Nevertheless, part of the Cone's portfolio of assets under
  management, located in Bahia state, are not subject of the current agreement.
  This is the second acquisition of warehouses that Blackstone is making in the
  country. On 25 November 2015 the company completed the purchase of 10 real
  estate properties from Brazilian real estate investment firm BR Properties
  for BRL 1.07bn (USD 310.4mn). Cone Suape's project portfolio comprises 13
  warehouses with a total area of 331,000 m2 and hosts around 70 customers.
  Blackstone, established in 1985, is a global alternative investment firm with
  USD 310.5bn in assets under management as of 31 March 2015, allocated in real
  estate private equity funds, hedge funds, and mutual funds. With a team of
  over 1,600 employees and 23 offices in North America, Europe and the
  Asia-Pacific region, the company provides financial and strategic advisory
  services, restructuring and reorganisation advisory and fund placement
  services. Blackstone is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and booked a
  net profit of USD 1.58bn in 2014.

  O grupo norte-americano de capital privado em participações Blackstone entrou
  em um acordo para adquirir uma participação majoritária no projeto Cone Suape
  de galpões (município de Cabo de Santo Agostinho, PE), operado pela gestora
  portuária e industrial Cone SA, fontes da mídia brasileira apuraram. Os
  termos financeiros não foram divulgados. Segundo a mídia brasileira Valor
  Econômico, a Cone SA vai deter uma participação minoritária no projeto. No
  entanto, parte da carteira de ativos sob gestão da Cone, localizados no Estado
  da Bahia, ficou de fora do negócio. Esta é a segunda aquisição de galpões que
  a Blackstone faz no Brasil. Em 25 de novembro de 2015, a empresa completou a
  compra de 10 imóveis da empresa brasileira de investimento imobiliário BR
  Properties, por BRL 1.07bn (USD 310.4mn). A carteira do projeto da Cone Suape
  está composta por 13 galpões com uma área total de 331,000 m2 que aluga para
  cerca de 70 clientes. A Blackstone, criada em 1985, é uma empresa global de
  investimentos alternativos com USD 310.5bn em ativos sob gestão, até à data
  de 31 de março de 2015, alocados em fundos de investimento imobiliário de
  capital privado, fundos hedge e fundos mútuos. Com uma equipe de mais de
  1,600 colaboradores e 23 escritórios na América do Norte, Europa e no região
  da Ásia-Pacífico, a empresa oferece serviços de assessoria financeira e
  estratégica, reestruturação e reorganização de consultoria e serviços de
  colocação de fundos. A Blackstone está listada na Bolsa de Valores da Nova
